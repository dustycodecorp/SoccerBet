# Quiniela-o-matic
[Please note that is is a work in progress, when a stable version is released this message will be removed] This a real-time quiniela app for soccer matches, the idea is simple you gather your friends all made their predictions
of the match (previously registered) in the app and wait to the end of the match to see who won. Note: this app does not accept two equal predictions.

No money have to be involved here, it's just for fun.
